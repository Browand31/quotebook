Remember, there's no such thing as the "real" world. What each person sees and feels,
 those are what shapes reality. This is what gives the world infinite potential. Even if you feel only darkness lies ahead,
 as long as you hold hands together, see it through as one, the world will never end - Morgana (Persona 5)

Do or do not, there is no try- Yoda (Star Wars)

The future is like the sea, you can go any direction you want, but it doesn't mean you'll get there- Hajime Hinata (Danganronpa)
